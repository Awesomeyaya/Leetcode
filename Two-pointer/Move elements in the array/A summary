The problems in this file is solved in the following way:

1. The reverse of the original problem: 
   move zeros : to collect nums which are not zero
   remove duplicates: to collect num which is different with the previous one 
   remove a target element: to collect the nums which are not the target 
   
2. Methods:
   create a variable Zero = 0,
   then use a for loop to go over each element in the array,
   if the array[i] is not the target, Zero = Zero + 1
   return Zero( length of the new length of the array, elements in the array stasity the requirements )
   
   i.e. 
   pointer = 0
   index of the return array
   when the condition is satisfied, pointer + = pointer 
   pointer + 1 == length of the returned array 
   
   condition:
   when nums[n] != the target value, which means create a new array. -- nums[pointer] = nums[n] 

3. Benefits: 
   modify the array in place O(n)with extra O(1) memory place. 
   
Tips : to remove duplicate elements, one needs to use set, which takes O(n) space. 

       if the last element matters, use range from 1 to len(nums)
       
       REMEMBER to judge whether the array is empty. i.e. if not nums: return0
