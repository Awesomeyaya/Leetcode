1. The simple two sum uses a hash table, the key is the nums in the array and the value is index of nums.

For a problem like a+b = target, one needs to convert it to b = target - a 

So one has to go over the array in a for loop, for each nums[i], finds whether target - nums[i] is in the hashmap.If it exists, 
return the index of nums[i] and target - nums[i].  If not, stores nums[i] in the hashtable. 

2. Two sums in a sorted array. 

As the array is sorted, it indicates that one should new two pointers. One is the start and the other is the end. 

The solution is to approximate the target from the two ends of the array. If nums[start] + nums[end] < target, it indicates
that the start should move forward so that start = start + 1. At last, return the index of a and b.
