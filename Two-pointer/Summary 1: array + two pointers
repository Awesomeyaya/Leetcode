leetcode 283, 27, 26, 167

Usage: 
remove target elements in a num array 
move target elements in a num array to the head/tail of the array. ie. move all zeros 
used in when the array is sorted 
Benefits:
in place 
How to use:

pointer = 0
index of the return array
when the condition is satisfied, pointer + = pointer 
pointer + 1 == length of the returned array 

condition:
when nums[n] != the target value, which means create a new array. -- nums[pointer] = nums[n] 

Tips: 
if the last element matters, use range from 1 to len(nums)
REMEMBER to judge whether the array is empty. ie. if not nums: return0
