In this problem, the return type is a list. So one cannot return each value when it is computed in the for loop.
Use the templet the solution gave.


Solution 1 : Naive Approach

create an empty list and append the value of each step to it.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity :O(1)

Solution 2: String Concatenation

Algorithm: check the divisibility by given numbers i.e. i % 3 == 0. And then concate the new string.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complextity: O(1)

Solution 3: Hash Table 

Algorithm:
