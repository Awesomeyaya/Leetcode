1. Two pointers are used in this problem. One needs to use the start and end index, also creates a mid = (start+end)/2
   mid = int(mid), which means to take the floor int of mid. 
   
   In this way, the start and end will never be at the same point. So it avoids some problem. 
   
   If the target is not found, return -1.
